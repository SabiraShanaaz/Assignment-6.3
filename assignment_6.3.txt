Explain the working of below pig script commands with an example:


1. LOAD: -Load command simply loads the data in the Pig.
             If the user wants to verify the execution of pig commands Diagnostic operators are used.

         -The syntax of load command consists of two parts separated by = .

         -The left part defines the name of the relation where the user wants to store the data 
             and the right part mentions how to store the data.
       
   Eg: relation_name = LOAD 'input file path' USING function as schema;


2. STORE: -Store command is used to store the data in the file system after the data is loaded in the file system.

          -After the execution of store command a directory is created with a specified name 
             and the data will be stored in it.

   Eg: STORE relation_name INTO 'directory_path' USING function;


3. DUMP: -DUMP is a diagnostic operator.It is used to print the contents of the relation on the console.

   Eg:DUMP relation_name;


4. FOREACH: -FOREACH operator is used for filtering.

            -It is used to generate specified data transformations oon column data.

   Eg:relation_name_2 = FOREACH relation_name_1 GENERATE (data);
            -Foreach is used with generate operator.


5. FILTER: -Filter operator comes under the filtering technique.

           -Based on a specified condition it selects the tuples from the relation.

   Eg:relation_name_2 = FILTER relation_name_1 BY (condition.
           -Filter is used along with BY.


6. GROUP BY: -The group by operator is used to group the data.The data is grouped into one or more relation.

             -The group by operator collects only the data having the same key.

   Eg:group_data = GROUP relation_name BY mark;


7. ORDER BY: -The order by operator is used to display the contents of the relation in sorted order.

             -It is sorted based on one or more fields.

   Eg:relation_name_2 = ORDER relation_name_1 BY (ASC|DESC);


8. DESCRIBE: -The describe command is used to view the schema of the relation.

   Eg:DESCRIBE relation_name;
